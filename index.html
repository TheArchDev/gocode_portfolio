			<a id="live-weather-app" class="anchor" href="#live-weather-app" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Live Weather App</h3>

			<p>This was an exciting project for various reasons. It was the first proper venture into getting real-world data involved in one of my own projects via a JSON API. It was a a chance to make use of my JavaScript skills and AJAX call functionality as well as providing some freedom to experiment with the HTML5 Canvas tool. Try this link to my <a href="Weather_App/fiveday.html">Live Weather App</a> page. I'm also working on an <a href="Weather_App/fivedayanimated.html"> Animated Live Weather App</a> here...</p>


		<h3>
			<a id="js-blackjack" class="anchor" href="#js-blackjack" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JS Blackjack</h3>

			<p>Earlier in the course I implemented a basic OOP version of Blackjack in Python to be played through the command line interface. This project followed on from that. I needed to make use of similar logic as before such that the dealer followed a pre-defined set of rules for the game to proceed based on the human player's input. This served as a useful side project to get a bit more practice with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Find the link to this <a href="Blackjack/blackjack_javascript_version.html">JS-Blackjack</a> page here!</p>
